# nkscaling (October 20 - 2021)

Main engine: nkscaling.R (combines all other files and runs the actual simulation)

Input file takes the simulation parameter values

*Currently, the simulation only runs for one iteration and one set of parameters. That is, each scenario (set of different parameters) needs to be run as a new job.*
